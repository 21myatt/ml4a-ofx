## DoodleClassifier

An interface for classifying doodles/drawings. The app lets you define a series of doodle categories, examples drawn under a webcam, and then learns to classify new doodles.

A tutorial video can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/196944929/). 

To change the OSC host, port, and address, edit the `osc_settings.xml` file in the data folder. By default, it is set to localhost, port 5000, address "/classification".
